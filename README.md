## Structure of the code

The repository is simply organized as follows:

- in the 'methods' folder are reported the scripts used to obtain the results with the methods presented in the paper, namely RWA, SSE and exact solution (RK4(5) algorithm). Inline documentation with references to the equations of the paper is included.
- in the 'error_computation' folder are reported the scripts used for the plots of the errors included in the paper
